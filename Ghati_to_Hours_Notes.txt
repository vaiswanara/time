Ghati-Phala to Hour-Minutes Conversion Notes
============================================

Definitions:
------------
- 1 Ghati = 24 minutes
- 1 Phala = 24 seconds (60 Phalas = 1 Ghati)
- 1 hour = 2.5 Ghatis
- 1 minute = 2.5 Phalas

Step-by-Step Conversion:
------------------------

1. **Write down the Ghatis and Phalas.**

2. **Convert Ghatis to minutes:**
   - Multiply the number of Ghatis by 24.
   - Example: 3 Ghatis × 24 = 72 minutes

3. **Convert Phalas to seconds:**
   - Multiply the number of Phalas by 24.
   - Example: 15 Phalas × 24 = 360 seconds

4. **Convert seconds to minutes:**
   - Divide the total seconds by 60 to get minutes.
   - Example: 360 seconds ÷ 60 = 6 minutes

5. **Add the minutes from Ghatis and Phalas:**
   - Example: 72 minutes (from Ghatis) + 6 minutes (from Phalas) = 78 minutes

6. **Convert total minutes to hours and minutes:**
   - Divide total minutes by 60 to get hours.
   - The remainder is the minutes.
   - Example: 78 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour and 18 minutes

7. **If you need the time from sunrise:**
   - Add the calculated hours and minutes to the sunrise time.

Examples:
---------

**Example 1:**
Convert 2 Ghatis 30 Phalas to hours and minutes.

- Ghatis: 2 × 24 = 48 minutes
- Phalas: 30 × 24 = 720 seconds
- 720 seconds ÷ 60 = 12 minutes
- Total: 48 + 12 = 60 minutes
- 60 minutes = 1 hour 0 minutes

**Example 2:**
Convert 5 Ghatis 45 Phalas to hours and minutes.

- Ghatis: 5 × 24 = 120 minutes
- Phalas: 45 × 24 = 1080 seconds
- 1080 seconds ÷ 60 = 18 minutes
- Total: 120 + 18 = 138 minutes
- 138 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours 18 minutes

**Example 3:**
Convert 1 Ghati 10 Phalas to hours and minutes.

- Ghatis: 1 × 24 = 24 minutes
- Phalas: 10 × 24 = 240 seconds
- 240 seconds ÷ 60 = 4 minutes
- Total: 24 + 4 = 28 minutes
- 28 minutes = 0 hours 28 minutes

Tips:
-----
- Always convert Phalas to seconds first, then to minutes.
- Add the minutes from Ghatis and Phalas before converting to hours and minutes.
- For time-of-birth or other calculations, add the result to the sunrise time of that day.
